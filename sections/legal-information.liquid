            <strong>SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY</strong> <br>
            In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or
            unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
            law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such
            determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>SECTION 16 - TERMINATION</strong> <br>
            The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the

            These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate
            these Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you

            <strong>SECTION 17 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong> <br>
            The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not

            Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and governs your use of the
